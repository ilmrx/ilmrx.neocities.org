I apologize, but to keep it short, this site is getting a MASSIVE rework soon (Broken Links, Design, everything pretty much) will all be fixed. I'm really sorry for troubling everyone with sites being broken, features being janky, but bear with me. I am 100% going to fix all this in the next major update. See you then");
